# Choria Broker and Server

Choria is a framework for building Control Planes, Orchestration Systems and Programmable Infrastructure.

This is a daemon and related tools written in Go that hosts services, autonomous agents and generally provide a secure hosting environment for callable logic that you can interact with from code.

Additionally, this is the foundational technology for a monitoring pipeline called Choria Scout.

More information about the project can be found on [Choria.IO](https://choria.io).
